### Instructions to Set Up, Run, and Test the Flutter Application

#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Flutter installed. If not, follow the [official installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- Ensure you have an IDE like Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code with Flutter and Dart plugins installed.

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   If you have the code in a Git repository, clone it using:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   If you have the code as a ZIP file, download and extract it.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. **Get Flutter Packages:**
   Fetch all the necessary Flutter packages by running:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

#### Step 2: Running the Application

1. **Start a Device:**
   - For a physical device, enable developer mode and USB debugging, then connect it to your computer.
   - For an emulator, start the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.

2. **Run the Application:**
   Execute the following command in the project directory:
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use your IDE's built-in functionality to run the app.

3. **Troubleshooting:**
   If you encounter issues, use:
   ```sh
   flutter doctor
   ```
   This command provides information on any missing dependencies or issues with your Flutter setup.

#### Step 3: Testing the Application

1. **Manual Testing:**
   - **Login Screen:** Start the app, enter username and password, and click on the login button to ensure it navigates to the Dashboard.
   - **Sign-Up Screen:** Use the sign-up button to navigate to the sign-up screen, fill out the form, and verify navigation back to the Dashboard.
   - **Change Credentials:** Use the change credentials button to navigate to the change credentials screen, fill out the form, and verify changes.
   - **Dashboard Navigation:** Click on each card (New Feature, Bill Payment, Account Management) to ensure they navigate to their respective screens.

2. **Automated Testing:**
   - **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for individual functions and business logic.
   - **Widget Tests:** Write widget tests for each screen to ensure UI components behave as expected.
   - **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests to verify the entire appâ€™s workflow.

   Create a test file in the `test` directory, e.g., `test/widget_test.dart`:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
   import 'package:your_project/main.dart';

   void main() {
     testWidgets('Login Screen Test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
       await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());

       expect(find.text('Login'), findsOneWidget);
       expect(find.text('Sign Up'), findsOneWidget);

       await tester.enterText(find.byType(TextFormField).first, 'username');
       await tester.enterText(find.byType(TextFormField).last, 'password');
       await tester.tap(find.byType(ElevatedButton));
       await tester.pump();

       expect(find.text('Dashboard'), findsOneWidget);
     });
   }
   ```

   Run tests using:
   ```sh
   flutter test
   ```

3. **Debugging:**
   - Use your IDE's debugging tools to set breakpoints and inspect variables.
   - Utilize `print` statements or Flutter's `debugPrint` for logging.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up, run, and test the Flutter application effectively. Make sure to customize the instructions based on your specific project details and file structure.
